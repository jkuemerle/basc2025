			<p>Playing games is not only entertaining, but can also be a great way to build and reinforce new skills. CTFs are a kind of computer security competition. Individuals are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skill. By combining hands-on learning and a little friendly competition, CTFs provide an engaging way to educate users about the latest security features and threats. During a CTF, you can hack vulnerable web applications to learn how security exploits work.</p>

			<p>At the beginning of this training, you will receive a set of custom applications. We challenge you to find and exploit the security vulnerabilities of those applications. You will be able to see points on the scoreboard, providing some additional incentive to this friendly competition. You will compete against your class, and at the end, we will recognize the winners.</p>
